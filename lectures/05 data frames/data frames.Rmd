- The most common way of storing data in R
- Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors
- A two-dimensional structure (rectangular data), with rows and columns
- Similar to a worksheet in Excel

## Tidy Data - Overview (Wickham 2017)

- What is data tidying?
  + Structuring datasets to facilitate analysis
- The tidy data standard is designed to:
  + Facilitate initial exploration and analysis of data
  + Simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together
- Principles closely related to relational algebra (Codd 1990)
- Advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. Easier to learn tools that work with tidy data because they have a underlying uniformity
- Specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows Râ€™s vectorised functions to shine.
- **dplyr**, **ggplot2** designed to work with tidy data

## Rules for a Tidy Data Set
- Each variable must have its own column
- Each observation must have its own row
- Each value must have its own cell

```{r, echo=F,out.width='100%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/04 Tidy Rules.png")
```

## A tidy data set
```{r,echo=F}
m2 <- select(match,Time, Team, Scorer, From, Type,Points, Score)
knitr::kable(slice(m2,1:10))
``` 
 
## mtcars data frame
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

- **mpg**	Miles/(US) gallon	
- **cyl**	Number of cylinders	
- **disp**	Displacement (cu.in.)	
- **hp**	Gross horsepower	
- **drat**	Rear axle ratio	
- **wt**	Weight (1000 lbs)	
- **qsec**	1/4 mile time	
- **vs**	V/S	
- **am**	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)	
- **gear**	Number of forward gears	
- **carb**	Number of carburetors

## mtcars sample data

```{r,echo=T}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:10,1:6])
```

## mtcars using **str()**
```{r,echo=T}
str(mtcars)
```
## head() and tail() functions
```{r,echo=T}
head(mtcars[,1:6])
tail(mtcars[,1:6])
```

## subset()
- The subset( ) function can be used to select variables and observations.
- Takes the data frame, the conditions, and the columns to return
```{r,echo=T}
subset(mtcars,cyl==6,select=c("mpg","cyl"))

```

## Challenge 5.1: Using the **subset** function
- List all the cars that have an **mpg** greater than the average
- List the car(s) with the greatest displacement (**disp**)

## Adding new columns to a data frame
- Often the initial data set may not contain sufficient information for analysis
- Adding new variables (columns) is an important feature to have
- Data frames support this: columns can be combined or new information used

```{r,echo=T}
mtcars$name <- rownames(mtcars)
mtcars[1:5,-(1:8)]
```

## Challenge 1.6
Create a new column on mtcars that contains kilometers per gallon. 


## The tibble
- Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviours to make life a little easier
- One of the unifying features of the tidyverse
- To coerce a data frame to a tibble, use as_tibble()
- A tibble can be created from individual vectors using tibble()
- The data set **ggplot2::mpg** is a tibble

## Tibble abbreviations

```{r,echo=T}
as_tibble(mtcars)[1:2,1:6]
```

|Abbreviation| Data Type |
|:------|:--------|
|int | integers |
|dbl | double (numeric)|
|chr | character vectors| 
|dttm | date-times| 
|fctr | categorical| 
|date | dates |


## Summary
- Data frames/tibbles are the most common way of storing heterogeneous data in R
- Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors, and shares properties of both a list and a matrix
- Key for processing rectangular data, ideally in "tidy" format (every row is an observation, every column a variable)

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
# this is a hack to call plot but make the plot tiny
plot(1:1,axes=FALSE,xlab = "", ylab="",cex = .001)
```
